# React Native app for crowd monitoring, live tracking and zone alert

### Features

- ```Search for images based on time```

   Given a date and time interval, it searches for all the images present in that time interval and then we can select an image and it will show all the deteced faces. Then we can click on the face and see all the occurences of that person throughtout the whole database.
   
- ```Live Tracking```

   Fetches the latest images from multiple cameras and then we can see all the faces present on selected any of the image. Then we can see all the occurece of that person sorted on time through which we can plot his path.

   All the images where some face is detected in a restricted zone/area will be displayed.
